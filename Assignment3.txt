First we will check the port status:
cmd: - sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
If the port is already listening, then we will check the services whether it is on ClusterIP or NodePort.
thw followinf cmd will give running services
cmd: - kubectl get svc
If it is ClusterIP, then we will change it to NodePort using following command
 :- kubectl edit service #servicename

Even after changing the type of Service if it is not working then we have to  delete all the old pods and services and apply the replicaSet.yaml
so that it will create the services again.
cmd: - kubectl apply -f replicaSet.yaml
Thereafter, we will try to run the application. If it fails to run again then the last option is to change the port in replicaSet.yaml
